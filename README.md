TO DO LIST:
- Implement 1 mini-game that is different for each carp.
- Add an easter egg. For example in the map, randomly (or according to a chosen algorithm) make some circus characters appear (e.g. una foquita pixel art, un senhor con bigote en una bici con una rueda gigante, un domandor de leones con un leon, un malabarista) each one of them, you can talk with them on the map and it opens a new "secret minigame"

- Animate carps to be "destroyed" when a clown has been defeated.
- Add animation to the gummy bear when moving on the map so the bear faces front or back depending on the movement.
- Make a list (globally at the game level) for a "unlocking condition". The condition is to unlock the final boss clown, so every time you play the game you need 3 out of 5 clown noses, but the color of the noses is different each time, so you don't know the order needed to unlock the final clown.
- Add many languages to game.
- Research about export to html5 ( to have a playable demo ) and IOS/Android to get it in our smartphones.
- Refactoring code. The code has not order or criterium. We should re-think it (Alias pasarle el mocho al codigo).
- Make a title.
- Add Difficulty selection.
